<p style="font-size: 8px;">   
Danny is interested in leveraging data to gain insights into his customers' behaviors and preferences. He wants to answer questions related to their visit patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. By understanding his customers better, he aims to provide a more personalized and enhanced experience for his loyal patrons.

These insights will play a pivotal role in his decision-making process, particularly regarding the expansion of his current customer loyalty program. Additionally, Danny needs assistance in creating simplified datasets that his team can readily examine without relying on SQL, making data analysis more accessible for his staff.
