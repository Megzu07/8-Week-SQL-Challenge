Subscription-based businesses have gained immense popularity, and Danny recognized a significant gap in the market. He aspired to launch a new streaming service dedicated solely to food-related contentâ€”a platform akin to Netflix but exclusively for culinary shows.

In 2020, Danny teamed up with a group of talented individuals to bring his vision to life, resulting in the birth of Foodie-Fi. They introduced monthly and annual subscription plans that granted subscribers unrestricted access to an extensive library of exclusive food-centric videos from around the globe.

Guided by a data-driven approach, Danny was determined to base all future investment decisions and feature enhancements on data insights. This case study delves into the utilization of subscription-style digital data to address pivotal business inquiries.</p>
